This repository tests out temporal score rescaling and constant noise rescaling according to the paper on TEMPORAL SCORE RESCALING FOR TEMPERATURE SAMPLING IN DIFFUSION AND FLOW MODELS. Standard DDPM code from https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch is altered to include temperature k and cns k_cns as well as a 1d CFG file called denoising_diffusion_pytorch_1d.py for toy examples.

First toy example see parallel_toy.ipynb in old code

Second toy example computes an approximation for scaled energy in parallel tempering. See tempered_energy.ipynb
